Un ejemplo de ello es Tweepy, un wrapper de Python que se comunica con la API de Twitter.\n",

    "Puede observarse un perfil de actividad distinto para cada usuario. Bill Gates ha mantenido una actividad constante de en torno a 30 tweets por mes durante todo el periodo estudiado. Elon Musk muestra una actividad inicial por debajo de la de Bill Gates pero, a partir de febrero de 2016, incrementó notablemente el número de tweets publicados. Ed Lee tiene una actividad muy alta sobre todo en el periodo 2017. Debido a las limitaciones que impone Twitter en las recuperaciones, cuanto más activo es un usuario, menor es el intervalo de tiempo para el que se recuperan tweets. En el caso de Ed Lee, dado que publica con mucha más frecuencia que el resto, con la misma cantidad de tweets recuperados se abarca menos de la mitad del rango temporal que con los otros."

    "El proceso de limpieza de texto, dentro del ámbito de text mining, consiste en eliminar del texto todo aquello que no aporte información sobre su temática, estructura o contenido. No existe una única forma de hacerlo, depende en gran medida de la finalidad del análisis y de la fuente de la que proceda el texto. Por ejemplo, en las redes sociales, los usuarios pueden escribir de la forma que quieran, lo que suele resultar en un uso elevado de abreviaturas y signos de puntuación. En este ejercicio, se procede a eliminar: patrones no informativos (urls de páginas web), signos de puntuación, etiquetas HTML, caracteres sueltos y números.\n",

    "Tokenizar un texto consiste en dividir el texto en las unidades que lo conforman, entendiendo por token el elemento más sencillo con significado propio para el análisis en cuestión, en este caso, las palabras.\n",

    "Existen múltiples librerías que automatizan en gran medida la limpieza y tokenización de texto, por ejemplo, la clase feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer de Scikit Learn, nltk.tokenize o spaCy. A pesar de ello, para este ejemplo, se define una función que, si bien está menos optimizada, tiene la ventaja de poder adaptarse fácilmente dependiendo del tipo de texto analizado.

    "### Term Frequency e Inverse Document Frequency\n",
    "Uno de los principales intereses en text mining, natural language processing e information retrieval es cuantificar la temática de un texto, así como la importancia de cada término que lo forma. Una manera sencilla de medir la importancia de un término dentro de un documento es utilizando la frecuencia con la que aparece (tf, term-frequency). Esta aproximación, aunque simple, tiene la limitación de atribuir mucha importancia a aquellas palabras que aparecen muchas veces aunque no aporten información selectiva. Por ejemplo, si la palabra matemáticas aparece 5 veces en un documento y la palabra página aparece 50, la segunda tendrá 10 veces más peso a pesar de que no aporte tanta información sobre la temática del documento. Para solucionar este problema se pueden ponderar los valores tf multiplicándolos por la inversa de la frecuencia con la que el término en cuestión aparece en el resto de documentos(idf). De esta forma, se consigue reducir el valor de aquellos términos que aparecen en muchos documentos y que, por lo tanto, no aportan información selectiva.\n",
    "\n",
    "El estadístico tf-idf mide cómo de informativo es un término en un documento teniendo en cuenta la frecuencia con la que ese término aparece en otros documentos.\n",
    "\n",
    "A continuación se muestra cómo calcular el valor tf-idf Sin embargo, en la práctica, es preferible utilizar implementaciones como TfidfVectorizer de Scikit Learn\n"
